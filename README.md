# modularity-dep-viz
RPM dependency visualisation in Modularity

This script visualizes build and runtime dependnecies of RPM packages. It's a pretty early version developed iteratively (read: hacked, ugly, steaming pile of anti-pattern garbage).

Based on [Harald's script](https://harald.hoyer.xyz/2014/01/14/self-hosting-fedora-base/).
